First sentence or two should be a succinct sumamary of what's wrong. You can describe as much as you like (and you can use markdown!)

# What's Bad?
1. PDF
2. A 20MB PDF with 7,176 pages.
3. Values are State, Municpality, and City with their respective number codes. No value for population.
4. Repeating headers on each page. Can't even copy paste easily (also 20MB into clipboard).
5. Link is for FTP. FTP is accessible via browser: ftp://ftp2.sat.gob.mx/
6. No simple way of finding this page via main page. 
7. Mainly, it's a 20MB PDF with 7,176 with a list of cities without populations.
